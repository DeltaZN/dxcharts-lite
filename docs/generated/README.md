All files in this folder were generated by script from `generator` folder

This script takes a list of TypeScript files, parses them, and generates data of interfaces found in them. 
The data is then used to create tables in markdown (.md) files. 
The tables include the name, type, and description of each interface. This makes it easy to visualize and understand the interfaces defined in the TypeScript files.
